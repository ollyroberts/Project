This data was gathered using the pre 29.08.2018 onehelixres.py and twohelixres.py. This regex allowed a gap of 3 non helix (not H or h in secstr) and a window of 3 on either side of the gap where there may be a proline e.g ( HHHHHPHH---HHHHHH). 

This regex before 30.08.2018 also only allowed 'H' and not 'h' after this date was changed to allow both H and h. This was changed in future versions
